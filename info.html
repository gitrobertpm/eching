				<h2>ABOUT</h2>
				<p class="infoP">The E Ching is a free digital simulation of the preeminent form of ancient divination (fortune telling), knwon as the I Ching, which is commonly translated as "The Book of Changes".</p>
				<p class="infoP">The I Ching, (pronounced "Yi Jing") is thousands of years old.</p>
				<p class="infoP">Its true origins are someting of a mystery, but it has strong connections to Taoism (Daoism), Feng Shui (Fung Shway), and Tai Chi (Tie Chee).</p>
				<p class="infoP">The idea behind I Ching practice is that the universe is of one-piece, and all things are connected in more ways than we can percieve with our five sense.</p>
				<p class="infoP">By methods of summoning the connectedness of all things and the underlying patterns that produce appearant randomness, the I Ching's wisdom, and the universe's will, may be ascertained.</p>
				<p class="infoP">One of the most common ways of using the I Ching is with three coins, which are flipped six times and added up to make a series of six broken or unbroken lines.</p>
				<p class="infoP">These six lines make an I Ching Hexagram.  There are sixty four possible hexagrams and each one may be interpreted to have a specific meaning that can offer insight and guidance.</p>
				<p class="infoP">Here, we use digital coins to produce entirely random hexagrams that are aimed at accomplishing the same thing.</p>
				<p class="infoP">It's easy and fun to use.</p>
				<p class="infoP">Obviously, no gaurantee can be made regarding the accuracy of the readings of this app, but if you follow the instructions, get your mind right, and use this app right, you have a better chance of getting more accurate results.</p>
				<p class="infoP">Good Luck.</p>
